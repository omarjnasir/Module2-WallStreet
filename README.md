Overview of Project:
The purpose of the analysis is to create code that will allow thousands od stocks to be analyzed and at the same be efficient.Refactoring of code is done to show that the run times are reduced.

Results:
For the year 2017 and 2018, the screen shots are displayed in the resources folder and it is shown that 2017 was a banner year for the stock market with the average return of 67.35%, but in 2018 the same stocks collapsed giving a negative 16.72% loss.The volatility of the stock market was displayed. So a portfoiio consisting of stocks would have to be balanced by bonds or other counter acting influences.


Summary:


The advantages of refactoring far outweigh its disadvantages. The advantages are as follows:
    -Refactoring Improves the Design of Software
    -Refactoring Makes Software Easier to Understand
    -Refactoring Helps Finding Bugs
   -Refactoring Helps Programming Faster
   
   The disadvantages are that it is costly and time consuming activity, so unless the code is to be used in the long run, refactoring may not be economical.

How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?

For our code, the advantage was in run time, and in ease of use and understanding.
